POSIX says &quot;must&quot; but the Linux page only says &quot;should&quot;. That was a mistake.<p>One somewhat kludgy fix would be to disallow argv[0] == NULL &amp;&amp; envp[0] != NULL. That allows launching a program with no args at all, which might be used somewhere in some ancient program, while disallowing launch with no command line args but with environment args, which is probably a bug.<p>(I liked the QNX approach to program loading. The kernel isn't involved. The &quot;exec&quot; functions link to a shared object, which requests memory and does the loading using <em>regular</em> I/O operations. The kernel contains no loader and is thus immune to problems from malformed executables.)<p>[1] <a href=\"https://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/sasc/doc750/html/lr2/zid-7281.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/sasc/doc750/...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/freebsd-manpages/execve.2freebsd.en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/freebsd-manpages/execve...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.4.0/neutrino/lib_ref/e/execve.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.4.0/neutrino/lib_ref/e...</a>",

Even a new garden fence is going to cost me around £5k. But also, my house would need to have a brick cladding put on after the insulation to get it past planning. There would also be a lot of remedial work required before installing the insulation, such as removing the existing pebbledash render. And I don't even have asbestos to worry about (as far as I know), unlike a lot of other properties of similar age.<p>I agree we're a long way off net zero, but don't you think spending all this money on marginal improvements to old houses would be better spent on the generation side of things? Personally I can't see a future in the UK that doesn't involve some kind of hydrogen or synthetic natgas generation. We're going to need to solve the generation side anyway.<p>I had district heating which I had in my last place, which was great and had the footprint and plumbing was comparable to that of a <em>regular</em> gas boiler.",
